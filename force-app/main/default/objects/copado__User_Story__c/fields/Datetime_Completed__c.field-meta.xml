    <description>This will get filled out with the current datetime the very first time this User Story gets marked as either &quot;Promote And Deploy&quot; or &quot;Ready To Promote&quot;. If this field is already filled out, it will not be updated, so this is filled in once and only once. This is filled in via the workflow rule &quot;Fill In Datetime Completed Field&quot;.</description>
